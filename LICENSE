1. Definitions
   “Software” means the code and associated materials in this repository.
   “Research Use” means non-commercial activities to study, evaluate, or develop the Software,
   performed internally by you (and your academic or corporate research collaborators), including
   experimentation, prototyping, and publishing academic papers about results. Research Use
   excludes any Production Use and any activity intended to provide features or functionality to
   customers or the public.

   “Production Use” means using the Software (or any derivative) to operate or support any product,
   service, or system that is offered, sold, licensed, provided to, or accessed by third parties,
   whether for a fee or free; or that materially supports a commercial offering.

   Subject to the terms below, Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   non-transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the Software
   solely for Research Use.

3. Limited Distribution for Research
   You may distribute the Software and your modifications only to members of your research team
   and named research collaborators, provided that: (a) each recipient receives a copy of this
   license and agrees to be bound by it; and (b) any further distribution complies with this
   Section 3. Public redistribution (e.g., publishing a fork for general use) is not permitted
   without Licensor’s written permission.

4. Restrictions
   a) No Commercial/Production Use. You may not use the Software for Production Use or any
      commercial purpose, including offering it as a service, incorporating it into a

   a) Research Patent License. For Research Use only, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive,
      non-transferable, royalty-free patent license to make, use, and modify the Software under
      Licensor’s patent claims that would be infringed by the unmodified Software.

   reinstatement at its discretion.
